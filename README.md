Hi i am dussanthan ..
I have created a task app using with HTML, CSS ,JavaScript, Boostrap and with PHP.
The Database with XAMPP MySql.
I am attached the sql file with my document.
user can import that file to the database easyly.
You can simply copy this file into the C:xampp/htdocs folder.
After complete copying the files you can run it with in the localhost server.
Important - You have to turn on apache and mysql in the xampp server.
Type this in the url tab ( localhost/TaskApp/home.php);
After the sccessful execution you can see the home page and Text link like ( Task Manager ) .
You can simply click that link and enter to the application.
And you can add/update/ and delete operations.
